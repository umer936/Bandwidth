My friend and I went to TAMUhack 2016, our first Hackathon. 

While there, we noticed people doing speedtests to find the best WiFi. 
We decided that should be automated! So far, the extension logs your upload and download speeds, latlon, and accuracy of the Geolocation fix. 

TODO: 
- Graph to show test points 
- Options page 
- Make an icon

In hindsight, this would probably work better as an Android app because the accuracy of phones is much better. However, we have seen the accuracy be better than expected.
